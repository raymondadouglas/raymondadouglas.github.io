You've found my (somewhat poorly maintained) weblog^. At this stage it's mostly archival, and you might prefer to look at:
- [My research bio](/research)
- [My various LessWrong posts](https://www.lesswrong.com/users/raymond-douglas)
- [My substack](https://legacymode.substack.com/), where I curate interesting news of people handing over authority to AIs
- [My twitter profile](https://x.com/raymondadouglas)

And also feel free to [email me](mailto:raymondadouglas@gmail.com): like many others, I enjoy hearing from people who happen to stumble across my blog, and if that stops being true, I will delete this sentence.

If you are really very curious, among the various archived material you will find:
- [*J'accuse*](/jaccuse.html), an implementation of a social deception game that I vibecoded in 2022 to prove a point, while someone else was trying to get a chat assistant to directly moderate the game.
- [*Swordfish*](/swordfish.html), a game I wrote by hand(!) with a friend back in 2016, optimised to be playable by many schoolboys crowded around a single keyboard.
- [*Pride and Prejudice*](/pride-and-prejudice), the 1894 illustrated edition, formatted for online reading, and greatly recommended to all men in want of a wife.
- [The about page](/about), rendered defunct by my pivot to research, but still with a few tantalising hints about my personality.
- [My old blog posts](/archive)
