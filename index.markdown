You've found my weblog^. 

Feel free to look around: maybe start with the page [about](/about) me and the site, or else look at the [archive](/archive) of all posts.

This is a general-purpose site, but if you're specifically interested in my research there's a separate page [here](/research).

And do feel free to say [hello](mailto:raymondadouglas@gmail.com): like many others, I enjoy hearing from people who happen to stumble across my blog, and if that stops being true, I will delete this sentence.
