        <h1>Raymond Douglas</h1>
        <a href="mailto:raymondadouglas@gmail.com">raymondadouglas@gmail.com</a>
        <p>I'm a research analyst at Telic Research, and a research affiliate at the University of Toronto CS department with David Duvenaud. I mainly work on understanding how AGI could affect society, and on the nature of agency in systems of all kinds. Previously, I was a research scholar at SERI MATS under Victoria Krakovna.</p>

My work has been discussed in [the Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/books/2025/may/04/the-big-idea-can-we-stop-ai-making-humans-obsolete), [the Times](https://www.thetimes.com/us/news-today/article/why-how-ai-lead-end-humanity-nx8zjhgft), and in my own piece for [the Economist](https://www.economist.com/by-invitation/2025/09/18/two-scholars-ask-whether-democracy-can-survive-if-ai-does-all-the-jobs). I also co-organised the workshop on [Post-AGI Civilizational Equilibria](https://post-agi.org/).

Some research highlights:

[**Gradual Disempowerment**](https://gradual-disempowerment.ai/) 
([*tweet thread*](https://x.com/DavidDuvenaud/status/1885009775185858823)) — a paper on how the proliferation of advanced AI might disrupt human influence over key societal systems by naturally and predictably displacing humans.

[**Decomposing Agency**](https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/jpGHShgevmmTqXHy5/decomposing-agency-capabilities-without-desires) — a post on how AI models might contribute different features to agent-like systems rather than simply being agents themselves.

[**Limitations of Agents Simulated by Predictive Models**](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.05829) — a workshop paper on theoretical challenges to eliciting agents from models that were pretrained offline on prediction.

[**"AI for Societal Uplift" as a Path to Victory**](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/kvZyCJ4qMihiJpfCr/ai-for-societal-uplift-as-a-path-to-victory) - a post where I argue that we should think about using AI advances to radically improve humanity's collective reasoning ability, so that we can navigate the risks it will unlock.
