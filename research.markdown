        <p>I'm a research analyst at Telic Research. I mainly work on understanding how AGI could affect society, and on the nature of agency in systems of all kinds. Previously, I was a research scholar at SERI MATS under Victoria Krakovna.</p>

Some research highlights:

[**Gradual Disempowerment**](https://gradual-disempowerment.ai/) 
([*tweet thread*](https://x.com/DavidDuvenaud/status/1885009775185858823)) — a paper on how the proliferation of advanced AI might disrupt human influence over key societal systems by naturally and predictably displacing humans.

[**Decomposing Agency**](https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/jpGHShgevmmTqXHy5/decomposing-agency-capabilities-without-desires) — a post on how AI models might contribute different features to agent-like systems rather than simply being agents themselves

[**Limitations of Agents Simulated by Predictive Models**](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.05829) — a workshop paper on theoretical challenges to eliciting agents from models that were pretrained offline on prediction
