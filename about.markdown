## About Me

I guess I'm a bit of a generalist. I did my degree in mathematics and philosophy mostly because I wanted good fundamentals and I didn't want to specialise.

Officially I am a part-time research analyst on AI strategy and differential progress, and a part-time writer of videos about dogs. In practice I try to stay flexible.

Over the past few years my main interests have been:
- **Research**, these days mostly on the future of AI and how it might affect society, with a particular interest in the notion of agency and goals.
- **Writing**, sometimes about AI, often satirical, originally plays but more recently screenplays.
- **Teaching**, mostly at little workshops, where I tend to teach epistemology, information theory, and sometimes a bit of music.
- **Startups**, usually little side projects: formerly a dating app and a charity that provided on-demand mentoring, then something about housing. Currently in a lull but I keep getting drawn back in.
- **Music**, mostly in the form of little singalongs, and mostly the guitar or the ukulele, although I dabble in the harmonica.

### "But who are you really?"

Some opinions:
- AI is probably the most important thing going on right now, and that there's a reasonable chance it will lead to a catastrophe
- It is often useful to reason about the world in terms of incentive landscapes, and to ask how the 'preferences' of a group might differ from the preferences of its members
- The part of the world I grew up in is having a crisis of faith: many structures that used to facilitate relationships have collapsed, been dismantled, or been outcompeted
- There are _enormous_ gains to thinking carefully about what you want and then trying to do it, as opposed to roughly imitating whatever you see other people doing

## About the site

It's a nice easy Jekyll site on Github Pages. I tweak the css a bit, I write little markdown files, and they miraculously appear on the internet.

### Aesthetics

I'm going with minimalism. This is basically the [default primer theme](https://github.com/pages-themes/primer), but I tinted the background a little and replaced blue links with dotted underlines that darken when you hover over them. I also decided to add a parallax dot effect in the background, because I wanted the site to feel slightly more distinct.

### A Brief History

I used to be on Ghost, because I worked for a company that used Ghost, but it was overproduced and too complex, and it was hard for me to publish posts if I pictured all my subscribers reading them, partly because lots of people I really liked and respected had subscribed.

So I nuked it and switched to this incredibly hacky static site where every page had a link to a boilerplate.js script that loaded the css. I let my thoughts branch a bit more, and it was more like a living document. But it was an unmanageable mess.

This is the third iteration, with some of the original posts preserved. For now it's minimalist, lightweight, and easy to maintain. We'll see how it goes!


## Frequently asked questions
(The current bar is about three times)

### ^?

It's a caret. I use it to track and denote unfinished things a bit like a proofreading caret, although those are usually lower, like this: â€¸. 


I also like it as a neutral icon which nods at exponentiation. Something something working in public, shipping before you're ready, compounding growth.
